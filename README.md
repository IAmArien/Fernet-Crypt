# Fernet-Crypt
Simple File Encryption using Fernet Cryptography module in Python. The script could provide six different types of hash encryption and creates a unique key with the help of a random generated keygen and a salted key. The program aims to transfer selected files which you have chosen and encrypt them while in process. This could be very helpful for privacy reasons and purposes, also for some homework, testing and experimentation, or just for a fun stuff. The script could also be modified and expanded to be able to maintain its use and purpose.

# NOTE
If you have tried already this script and you encounter the drag the key.key file, the input there should be enclosed in a double qoutes, or if you don't want then you can still modify the py file if you want.
And also you have to install the fernet cryptography module by using pip or any source of installation to be able to use it in python, and also some more requirements if there are still errors encountered.
